   Known regressions
   ..................

   - :code:`python -m build` reads both dependencies and optional-dependencies.
     The requirements files cannot include pip-tools syntax like ``-c prod.in``.
     Reproduce:
     In pyproject.toml, change dependencies to ``.in`` files.
     Run :code:`python -m build`
     or :code:`src/drain_swamp/cli_igor.py build --kind="0.0.1"`
     Result: build bombs
     Mitigation: Recursively include .in file requirements to build .unlock files
