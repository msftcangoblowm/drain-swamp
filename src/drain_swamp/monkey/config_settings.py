    ``config settings`` command line options to the build back end.

    This is the communication flow:

    .. code-block:: text

       - build

    - temp file is in ``pyproject.toml`` format/style. ``project.name`` and
      ``project.version`` are required but not used. Contains a section, "config-settings".
      That section, contains key/value pairs. Type are both str.

      Which key value pairs to pass in depends on what is required by
      build plugins. Current key pairs:

      ``kind = "tag"``

      ``set-lock = "1"``
