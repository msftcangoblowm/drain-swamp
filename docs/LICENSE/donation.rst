Legacy banking
"""""""""""""""

As a non-US non-EU centric project, simply don't want the burden of
dealing with legacy banking system. NPOs insist on kyc or impose other
burdens. Governments, impose lawfare, causing every transaction to need
to be verified and can hold the funds without reason and often without recourse.

As coders, who should be focusing on the code, imposing burdens and kyc,
means the funds come with strings requiring our time.

This violates the point of a donation, to focus time and attention on the
project. Not on never ending conformance rituals and tests of loyality
and group identity.
