Sphinx doc?/conf.py
--------------------

Sphinx are either in:

- doc/conf.py

or

- docs/conf.py

Contains block

.. code-block:: text

   # @@@ editable vampire_smoothie_machines
   copyright = "2023â€“2024, Dave Faulkmore"
   # The short X.Y.Z version.
   version = "0.0.1"
   # The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.
   release = "0.0.1"
   # The date of release, in "monthname day, year" format.
   release_date = "April 25, 2024"
   # @@@ end

Can start out the block as

Without a snippet_co

.. code-block:: text

   # @@@ editable
   # @@@ end

or with a snippet_co

.. code-block:: text

   # @@@ editable vampire_smoothie_machines
   # @@@ end

And the block will be filled in by these commands

More than one snippet (in Sphinx doc?/conf.py)

.. code-block:: shell

   drain-swamp seed
   drain-swamp edits --kind="0.0.1" --snip="vampire_smoothie_machines"

Only one snippet; snippet_co will be automatically inferred

.. code-block:: shell

   drain-swamp seed
   drain-swamp edits --kind="0.0.1"
